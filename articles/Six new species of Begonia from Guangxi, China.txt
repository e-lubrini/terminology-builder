With currently 1980 described species, the mega-diverse Begonia is now perhaps the 5th largest flowering plant genus, expanding rapidly from ca. 900 species in 1997 to its current size in merely two decades. In continuation of our studies of Asian Begonia, we report six additional new species from Guangxi, the region/province harboring the second richest Begonia flora of China.
Based on morphological and molecular data, the new species B. aurora belongs to Begonia sect. Platycentrum, while the other five new species (viz. B. larvata, B. longiornithophylla, B. lui, B. scabrifolia, and B. zhuoyuniae) are members of Sect. Coelocentrum. Somatic chromosome numbers of B. longiornithophylla and B. zhuoyuniae at metaphase were counted as 2n = 30, consistent with previously reports for Sect. Coelocentrum.
With the addition of the six new species, the total number of Begonia species in Guangxi increases from 86 to 92. Detailed description, line drawings, and color plates are provided to aid in identification.
With currently 1980 accepted species (Hughes et al. 2015), the mega-diverse genus Begonia L. is the fastest growing and now perhaps the fifth largest flowering plant genus (Moonlight et al. 2018), doubling from ca. 900 species in 1997 (Frodin 2004) to the current size in merely two decades. One of the major impetus of Begonia’s phenomenal growth in the past decades has been the passion and dedication of Dr. Ching-I Peng (Fig. 1) and his collaborations with Begonia researchers and enthusiasts around the world; together the effort has resulted in 81 publications and 98 new Begonia species (Chung 2020). Sadly, Dr. Peng died of illness on 1 May 2018 and his prolific career of Begonia research was ended prematurely (Chung 2020), leaving numerous unfinished works.

To continue his enduring legacy of Begonia research, we here report six new Begonia species that were discovered during Dr. Peng’s field trips to Guangxi, China. Known for its splendid limestone karst (Chung et al. 2014; Tseng et al. 2019), Guangxi also harbors the second richest Begonia flora of China, surpassed only by Yunnan Province (Tian et al. 2018). The addition of these six new species increases the total number of Begonia species in Guangxi from 86 (Dong and Liu 2019; Tong et al. 2019) to 92, with more than 1/4 of the Begonia species named by Dr. Peng and his collaboration with Guangxi Institute of Botany (Chung 2020). According to morphological characters and comparison with allied species, one of the six new species, B. aurora, might be assigned to Sect. Platycentrum (Klotzsch) A.DC. (sensu Moonlight et al. 2018), while the other five, viz. B. larvata, B. longiornithophylla, B. lui, B. scabrifolia, and B. zhuoyuniae, are allied to Sect. Coelocentrum Irmsch. (sensu Chung et al. 2014). Molecular phylogenetic analyses were conducted to further assure their sectional placements.
Rhizomes of the six new species collected in the field were cultivated in the experimental greenhouse of the Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. Full grown plants with flowers and fruits were used for morphological observation and comparison with morphologically similar species.
Root tips of Begonia longiornithophylla and B. zhuoyuniae were pretreated with 2 mM 8-hydroxyquinoline solution at 15–18 °C for about 8 h and fixed overnight in ethanol-acetic acid (3:1) below 4 °C and then macerated by an enzyme mixture containing 2% Cellulase Onozuka R-10 (Yakult Honsha, Tokyo, Japan) and 1% Pectolyase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at about 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, chromosomes were stained with a 2% Giemsa solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Following Levan et al. (1964), the chromosome complements were classified based on centromere position at mitotic metaphase. Voucher specimens (B. longiornithophylla: Peng et al. 21518 and B. zhuoyuniae: Peng et al. 21061) are deposited in HAST.
DNA sequences of three non-coding plastid DNA regions, ndhA intron, ndhF-rpl32 spacer, and rpl32-trnL spacer, were used for phylogenetic analysis according to Moonlight et al. (2018), the most comprehensive phylogenetic study of Begonia up to date. DNA sequences of B. scabrifolia were generated by PCR and the remaining five new species were retrieved from full plastome sequences assembled for our ongoing phylogenomic projects of Begonia using the genome skimming approach (Twyford and Ness 2017). Additionally, DNA sequences of the three regions were also obtained from whole plastom sequence of B. bamaensis that is morphologically similar to B. scabrifolia.
High quality genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). The quantity and quality of DNA were then measured by QubitTM 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) and by NanoDropTM 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA), respectively. For B. scabrifolia, PCR amplification and DNA sequencing followed Thomas et al. (2011). For the remaining five new species and B. bamaensis, the genomic DNA was sent to whole genome shotgun sequencing (Illumina Hiseq, 250 bp paired-end reads) in the High Throughput Genomics Core at Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica (BRCAS). The sequencing quality of the raw reads were then evaluated by FASTQC v0.11.5 (Andrews 2010). Low quality portions of the reads were trimmed and filtered out by Trimmomatic 0.36 (Bolger et al. 2014). Subsequently, the published plastome sequences of Begonia (Harrison et al. 2016) were used as reference to perform reference-based assembly using the option “Map to Reference” in Geneious Prime (Kearse et al. 2012) to generate a daft genome. Reads were subsequently mapped back to the draft genome to check if there were any problematic assemblies which might be resulted from some minor structural differences between our data and the references. By extracting the correct regions (as contigs) and mapping reads on them to extend these contigs, the problematic parts could be resolved. These extended contigs were mapped back to the draft sequence to correct the assembly, generating a circular genome. The completely assembled plastomes were annotated by GeSeq (Tillich et al. 2017) web tool based on plastomes of Begonia (Harrison et al. 2016). The start and stop codons of each gene were manually checked and adjusted under Geneious Prime. The tRNA genes were further checked by referring to the secondary structures drawn by tRNAscan-SE web server (Chan et al. 2019).
In addition to the six new species and B. bamaensis, DNA sequences of 80 additional Asian Begonia species were downloaded from NCBI (Additional file 1), including one species of Sect. Alicida (§ALI), six species of Sect. Baryandra A.DC. (§BAR), eight species of Sect. Coelocentrum Irmsch. (§COE), 16 species of Sect. Diploclinium (Lindl.) A.DC. (§DIP), one species of Sect. Haagea (Klotzsch) A.DC. (§HAA), one species of Sect. Lauchea (Klotzsch) A.DC. (§LAU), three species of Sect. Parvibegonia A.DC. (§PAR), seven species of Sect. Petermannia (Klotzsch) A.DC. (§PET), 35 species of Sect. Platycentrum (Klotzsch) A.DC. (§PLA), two species of Sect. Reichenheimia (Klotzsch) A.DC. (§REI), and B. boisiana Gagnep. not yet assigned to section (§Ignota). Begonia rigida Linden ex Regel of Sect. Pritzelia (Klotzsch) A.DC. (§PRI) and B. komoensis Irmsch. of Sect. Tetraphilia A.DC. (§TET) were included as outgroups based on Moonlight et al. (2018).
The three plastid sequences were concatenated using amas-0.93 (Borowiec 2016). Sequences were aligned using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley 2013). The final alignment is available as the Additional file 2. The maximum likelihood analyses with 1000 bootstrap resampling were conducted using RAxML-HPC (Stamatakis et al. 2008), with a gamma model of rate heterogeneity and the substitution model GTR + G+I.
The alignment (Additional file 2) of the concatenated matrix of the three plastid regions contained 4532 characters [ndhA: 1481 bp (87 sequences); ndhF-rpL32: 1455 bp (85 sequences); rpL32-trnL: 1596 bp (87 sequences)]. The maximum likelihood tree reconstructed by RAxML-HPC and bootstrap support (BS) values are depicted in Fig. 2. The overall relationship is highly congruent with Moonlight et al. (2018), with both Sect. Platycentrum (BS = 96) and Sect. Coelocentrum (BS = 96) supported as monophyletic groups. As expected by their respective morphological characters, B. aurora is placed within Sect. Platycentrum, and the other five new species (i.e., B. larvata, B. longiornithophylla, B. lui, B. scabrifolia, and B. zhuoyuniae) are placed within Sect. Coelocentrum. Within Sect. Platycentrum, B. aurora is sister to B. ceratocarpa S.H.Huang & Y.M.Shui with good support (BS = 85).

Our phylogenetic analyses placed Begonia aurora in Sect. Platycentrum sensu Moonlight et al. (2018) with strong support (Fig. 2). Amongst the other 35 sampled species of the section, B. aurora is sister to B. ceratocarpa (BS = 85). Morphologically, B. aurora is somewhat similar to B. versicolor Irmsch. in its hairy leaves with small cone-like structures on leaf blade. Nevertheless, B. aurora can be easily distinguished from B. versicolor by its dark green (vs. variegated or pure green) leaves, white (vs. pink) tepals, and 3-locular (vs. 2-locular) ovary.

CHINA. Guangxi, Jingxi County, Biaolin Town, Longjing, on rocks of limestone hill, 25 Aug 1935, in flowers and with dry fruit, S. P. Ko 55623 (IBSC!, paratype of Begonia bonii var. remotisetulosa); Baise City, Jingxi County, Wuping Town, Yixing Village, Pai Lin Tun, Baiyan Cave, elev. 730 m, 23°09’28”N, 106°35’4”E, on limestone hill, 22 May 2007, Ching-I Peng 21111, with Yan Liu, Hai-Shan Gao, Kuo-Fang Chung, Ming-Chao Yu, and Shi-Nian Lu (HAST-117599), Ching-I Peng et al. 21112 (HAST-117600).
Begonia lui was first proposed in S.-M. Ku’s master thesis (Ku 2006) as Begonia koi S.M.Ku et al., sp. nov. ined. based on a single collection S. P. Ko 55623 (IBSC). This specimen was cited in Shui and Chen (2005) as the paratype of Begonia bonii var. remotisetulosa Y.M.Shui & W.H.Chen, which was treated as a synonym Begonia debaoensis C.I Peng, Yan Liu & S.M.Ku (Ku et al. 2006) in the Flora of China (Gu et al. 2007). Because S. P. Ko 55623 differs considerably from the holotype of B. bonii var. remotisetulosa [Y. M. Shui et W. H. Chen B2004-91 (KUN!)] by its thicker rhizomes, longer internodes, larger leaf blades, white maculation in intercostal areas, larger fruits, and rectangular capsule wing, Ku (2006) named the collection as B. koi after its collector S. P. Ko (高錫朋). However, despite our continuous effort in searching for the plant, the collecting locality of S. P. Ko 55623 [廣西省 (Guangxi Province) 靖西縣 (Jingxi County) 表林鄉 (Biaolin Town) 隴徑 (Longjing)] could not be located and the species remained insufficiently known. This puzzle was resolved when the population in Wuping Town was discovered by Mr. Shi-Nian Lu.
Morphologically, Begonia lui somewhat resembles B. crystallina Y.M.Shui & W.H.Chen from Yunnan in the leaf shape and indumentum (Shui and Chen 2005); however, the leaf size of the former species is smaller than the latter. Additionally, B. lui has slightly rugose leaves, persistent stipules, shorter petioles and larger flowers that can be distinguished from B. crystallina.

Begonia scabrifolia has long been cultivated in Guilin Botanical Garden, Guangxi. Its precise origin is not known.
The species epithet refers to the rough and scabrous leaf surface of the adaxial side.
Begonia scabrifolia is similar to B. bamaensis Yan Liu & C.I Peng (Liu et al. 2007) in their variegated ovate leaves, white to pinkish tepals and zygomorphic androecium, differing in its persistent stipules and bracts (vs. caducous), sericeous pedicels, abaxial sides of outer tepals (vs. pilose), and straight abaxial wing of capsules (vs. markedly curved toward one side). Phylogenetically, B. scabrifolia is sister to B. lui and together they form the sister clade of B. bamaensis (Fig. 2). As B. scabrifolia is only known from a cultivated plant in Guilin Botanical Garden without collecting locality, we are hoping that the description of this species can stimulate exploration to areas adjacent to the type localities of B. lui and B. bamaensis for the wild population of B. scabrifolia.

Somatic chromosomes of Begonia zhuoyuniae at metaphase were counted as 2n = 30 (Fig. 9b), identical to the number reported by Han et al. (2018) as well as majority of species of Sect. Coelocentrum (Chung et al. 2014). The length of chromosomes varied from ca. 0.8 to 1.3 µm. The centromere positions of several small chromosomes could not be determined. However, most chromosomes were metacentric. Satellites were not observed.
Known only from two limestone caves in Donglan County and Bama Yao Autonomous County, northwestern Guangxi.
Flowering from February to May; fruiting from April to July.
The specific epithet honors the visionary Dr. Cecilia Koo Yan Zhuo-yun (辜嚴倬雲), founder of Dr. Cecilia Koo Botanic Conservation Center (KBCC) that aims to conserve tropical and subtropical plants and maintain earth’s rich biodiversity.

Begonia zhuoyuniae somewhat resembles B. aurantiflora C.I Pen, Yan Liu & S.M.Ku (Peng et al. 2008) in the elongated rhizomes, differing by its smaller leaves (2.5–5 × 2–4 vs. 7–11 × 5.5–10 cm) and pink tepals (vs. orange). Begonia zhuoyuniae is also similar to B. semiparietalis Yan Liu, S.M.Ku & C.I Peng (Ku et al. 2006) but can be distinguished from the latter by the thinner (2–6 vs. 9–12 mm) and generally elongated rhizomes (5–25 vs. 4–12 mm), smaller leaves (2.5–5 × 2–4 vs. 8–12 × 6–10 cm), scabrous (vs. pilose) abaxial leaf surface, and hairy (vs. glabrous) peduncles. A detailed comparison of the three species is provided in Table 3.
